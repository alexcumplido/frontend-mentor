## The challenge

To practice working with JSON data, we provide a local `data.json` file for the activities. You'll be able to pull the data from there.
Users should be able to:
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
- Expected behaviour: the text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For daily, it should read "Yesterday - 2hrs. For weekly it shoud read "Last Wee - 32hrs".
