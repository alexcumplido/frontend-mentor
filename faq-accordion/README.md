### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Looking forward to replace the img tags by svg tags.

### Useful resources
- [Background position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-position). This helped me figurating how to position the backgroubd image in desktop view.
